Tim Brecht: local UW modifications to prevent sys161 from waiting for a gdb
  connection when the "hang" function is called.
  This is called when there is a fatal error (e.g., duplicate TLB entries).
  The -H option can be used to hang and wait for the debugger to connect
  (i.e., what was the default behaviour).
  Changes made to main/console.c and main/main.c

  This was needed because our autotesting scripts used to test student
  code would hang and wait for a gdb connection and it seemed easier
  to modify the default behaviour for sys161 than to modify both sys161
  and our scripts.
